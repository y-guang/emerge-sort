🛠️ Under Active Development

**Emerge Sort** is a sorting algorithm designed for scenarios where **human judgment** and **error** are part of the process. It focuses on three key principles:

- ✅ **Fault-Tolerance** – Errors in pairwise comparisons shouldn't catastrophically affect the final ranking.
- 🎯 **Unbiasedness** – Average estimate converges to the true ranking.
- 🌐 **Emergent Cohesion** – Enables global order to **emerge** from noisy, local judgments by individuals.

This makes Emergence Sort especially suited for **psychological experiments**, **crowdsourced ranking**, and any case where sorting is performed by **fallible human observers**.

## Status

- ✅Algorithm finalized.
- 🚧 Production-ready implementation under development.
  - Python  - implementation coming soon.
  - JavaScript - implementation coming soon.
  - Matlab - based on community needs.
- 🚧 Preprint paper in preparation.
